# My last week

## How was I last week?

I did everything on time, also including the foreign language module, for which I was given an interesting assignment. For example,

Dear Guest, Welcome to my flat. I hope you will enjoy your stay in my hometown of Ivanovo! Please make yourself at home! Here are a few things you should keep in mind to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable: after cooking, turn on the hood or open a window, also if you use the oven, open it afterwards to let it cool down. Also, if you're heating food in the microwave, please cover the food with a dome. Also, I would appreciate it if you water the flowers and plants once every three days and feed the fish every day. My family doesn't lock the mailbox because it usually only receives advertisements. I would appreciate it if you would just bring the mail to the flat every few days. I have another request, I have two dogs living in my flat and they need to be walked and fed twice a day in the morning and evening.
All the best,
Marina

## My review of the week

I think I spent last week productive and useful because I completed all my assignments and work on time and spent my free time with my favorite people and activities.
