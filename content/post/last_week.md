# My last week

## How was I last week?

I'm glad you decided to read my first post. I'll start by saying that everyone means different things by "productive. I will tell you how I spent last week. It started, of course, with lectures and seminars, and I've been going over the Files and presentations on the course material needed for the lab work. 

In addition, I am active in the student committee, in particular in the scientific student society, I am interested in articles, their translation, deriving formulas and writing programs on certain data. More specifically, I've done three lab papers, including presentations and reports on operating systems, and I've also written programs in two programming languages in other disciplines. 

Thanks to the fact that I did everything at the beginning of the week, I was able to go to my hometown early for the holidays and spend time with my family. We watched a movie together on TV, specifically the new version of Spider-Man 2019, starring Tom Holland.

## My review of the week

I think I spent last week productive and useful because I completed all my assignments and work on time and spent my free time with my favorite people and activities.
